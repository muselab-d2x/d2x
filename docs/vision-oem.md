# Customer Org Management Architecture

## Executive Summary

This architecture addresses critical business challenges in managing multiple Salesforce customer org configurations, offering significant ROI through:

- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces per-release effort from 320 hours (80 customers Ã— 4 hours) to ~8-16 hours of oversight
- **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates exposed credentials through centralized secrets management
- **Scalability**: Supports growing customer base through automation
- **Security**: Implements GitHub Advanced Security scanning and proper secret management
- **Compliance**: Enables audit trails and standardized processes

## 1. Repository Architecture

### a. Base Customer Org Repository

Purpose:
- Acts as the template repository containing the base configuration for customer orgs
- Includes common CumulusCI configurations, scripts, and workflows

Features:
- Branch Structure:
  - Use branches to represent different versions or environments (e.g., main, develop, release)
- GitHub Features:
  - Enable issues, wikis, and projects for documentation and tracking

### b. Per-Customer Repositories

Forking Strategy:
- Each customer gets a repository that is a fork of the base customer org repository
- This allows you to push updates to the base repo and have customers merge changes into their forks

Benefits:
- Inheritance of Changes:
  - Easy propagation of updates from the base repo to customer repos
- Customization:
  - Customers can have specific configurations or overrides in their repositories

Management:
- Naming Conventions:
  - Use consistent naming for customer repos (e.g., customer-<CustomerName>)
- Access Control:
  - Restrict access to customer repositories to authorized personnel only

### c. Forks and Collaboration

Additional Forks:
- Developers or team members can fork customer repositories as needed for development or testing
- Pull requests can be used to merge changes back into the customer repo

## 2. Secrets and Secure Configuration Management

### a. GitHub Secrets

Per-Repository Secrets:
- Store customer-specific secrets (e.g., Salesforce credentials, API keys) in the customer repository's Secrets
- GitHub encrypts these secrets and makes them available to workflows

Security Considerations:
- Least Privilege:
  - Only store secrets necessary for that customer
- Rotation Policies:
  - Implement regular secret rotation to enhance security

### b. GitHub Environments

Purpose:
- Environments in GitHub can be used to define variables and secrets that are environment-specific (e.g., staging, production)

Features:
- Protection Rules:
  - Require approvals before workflows can run against certain environments
- Environment Secrets:
  - Override repository-level secrets for specific environments

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Security Enhancement (Week 1-2)**
   - Set up GitHub Advanced Security
   - Implement centralized secrets management
   - Configure secret scanning

2. **Base Repository Setup (Week 2-3)**
   - Create template repository
   - Define standard configurations
   - Establish branching strategy

3. **Automation Development (Week 3-4)**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflows
   - Develop deployment automation
   - Set up testing framework

4. **Customer Migration (Week 4-8)**
   - Pilot with 2-3 customers
   - Validate processes
   - Roll out to remaining customers in batches

## ROI Analysis

### Current Costs (80 Customers)
- Manual deployment time: 320 hours/release
- Security risks from exposed credentials
- Limited scalability
- High error potential

### Projected Benefits
- **Time Savings**: 95% reduction in deployment effort
- **Security**: Elimination of credential exposure risk
- **Quality**: Reduced deployment errors through automation
- **Scalability**: Linear cost doesn't increase with customer growth
- **Compliance**: Automated audit trails and standardized processes

### Risk Mitigation
- Credential exposure
- Deployment errors
- Compliance violations
- Customer satisfaction impact

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve architecture
2. Allocate resources for implementation
3. Begin pilot program with select customers
4. Develop training materials
5. Create rollout schedule
