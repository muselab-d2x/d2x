# 🔧 D2X Workflow Patterns

## Core Concepts

D2X workflows are built on two key principles:

-   🧩 Small, composable pieces that can be mixed and matched
-   🔐 Security-first design with credential isolation

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Workflow Architecture"
        subgraph "Security Layer"
            Auth["🔐 Authentication"]
            Session["🎫 Session Management"]
        end

        subgraph "Core Components"
            Validate["✅ Validation"]
            Deploy["🚀 Deployment"]
            Test["🧪 Testing"]
            Notify["📢 Notification"]
        end

        subgraph "Outputs"
            Results["📊 Results"]
            Logs["📝 Logs"]
            Artifacts["📦 Artifacts"]
        end

        Auth --> Session
        Session --> CoreOps["Core Operations"]
        CoreOps --> Outputs
    end
```

## 🚀 Deployment Patterns

### Feature Branch Deployment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Dev
    participant GH as GitHub
    participant Auth as Auth Flow
    participant SF as Salesforce

    Dev->>GH: Create Feature Branch
    Dev->>GH: Push Changes
    GH->>Auth: Request Session
    Auth->>SF: Create Scratch Org
    Auth-->>GH: Return Session
    GH->>SF: Deploy Changes
    SF-->>GH: Validation Results
    GH-->>Dev: Status Update
```

### Production Deployment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Lead
    participant PR as Pull Request
    participant GH as GitHub
    participant Auth as Auth Flow
    participant SF as Salesforce

    Lead->>PR: Approve Changes
    PR->>GH: Merge to Main
    GH->>Auth: Request Prod Session
    Auth->>GH: Require Approvals
    Note over GH: Wait for Required Approvals
    Auth-->>GH: Grant Session
    GH->>SF: Deploy to Production
    SF-->>GH: Deployment Results
```

## 🧪 Testing Frameworks

D2X provides reusable testing patterns that can be composed into comprehensive test suites:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Test Framework"
        subgraph "Unit Tests"
            Apex["Apex Tests"]
            LWC["LWC Tests"]
        end

        subgraph "Integration Tests"
            OrgConfig["Org Configuration"]
            DataLoad["Test Data"]
            Features["Feature Validation"]
        end

        subgraph "User Acceptance"
            Sandbox["Sandbox Prep"]
            UserFlow["User Flows"]
            Validation["Acceptance Criteria"]
        end

        Unit["Unit Tests"] --> Integration["Integration Tests"]
        Integration --> UAT["User Acceptance"]
        UAT --> Release["Release Ready"]
    end
```

## 🛡️ Security Workflows

### Two-Stage Authentication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Job as GitHub Job
    participant Base as Base Environment
    participant Session as Session Environment
    participant SF as Salesforce

    Job->>Base: Request Access
    Base->>SF: Exchange Token
    SF-->>Base: Access Token
    Base->>Session: Store Token
    Session-->>Job: Provide Access
    Note over Session: Token Auto-Expires
    Session->>Job: Revoke Access
```

### Protected Deployments

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GH as GitHub
    participant Env as Environment
    participant SF as Salesforce

    Dev->>GH: Request Deploy
    GH->>Env: Check Protection Rules
    alt Requires Approval
        Env->>GH: Request Approvals
        Note over GH: Wait for Approvers
    end
    GH->>SF: Execute Deploy
    SF-->>GH: Results
```

## 📋 Change Management

### Standard Change Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> FeatureBranch
    FeatureBranch --> Development: Create PR
    Development --> Review: Tests Pass
    Review --> Staging: Approved
    Staging --> Production: Final Approval
    Production --> [*]: Deployed
```

### Emergency Change Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> HotfixBranch
    HotfixBranch --> Review: Critical Fix
    Review --> Production: Emergency Approval
    Production --> Development: Backport
    Development --> [*]: Synced
```
