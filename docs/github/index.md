# ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Platform Features

D2X leverages GitHub's platform features in novel ways to create a secure, scalable DevOps solution:

## üèóÔ∏è Core Platform Features

### Environments

GitHub Environments become a secure credential vault and access management system:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "GitHub Environments"
        Base["Base Environment<br/>Long-term Credentials"]
        Session["Session Environment<br/>Temporary Access"]
        Protection["Protection Rules<br/>Access Controls"]

        Base -->|"Token Exchange"| Session
        Protection -->|"Gates"| Session
    end
```

### Actions

Reusable workflows enable composable automation while maintaining security:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "GitHub Actions"
        Reusable["Reusable Workflows"]
        Composite["Composite Actions"]
        Security["Security Checks"]

        Reusable -->|"Compose"| Composite
        Security -->|"Gate"| Composite
    end
```

### Advanced Security

Native security features protect your entire pipeline:

-   Secret scanning
-   Code scanning
-   Dependency analysis
-   Security policies

### Repository Features

From wikis to projects, every feature serves a purpose:

-   Branch protection
-   Status checks
-   Automated reviews
-   Documentation

### Network Graph

The Network graph in GitHub is a powerful tool that allows you to visualize the relationships between repositories, including forks and branches. It provides a clear and interactive way to understand how different repositories are connected and how changes flow between them.
