# ðŸ¤– Automation Architecture

## Automation Layers

D2X's automation architecture is built on multiple layers to ensure efficient and reliable automation of your Salesforce workflows.

### 1. Workflow Orchestration

- **GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Actions to orchestrate complex workflows.
- **Reusable Workflows**: Create reusable workflows to standardize automation across projects.
- **Event-Driven Automation**: Trigger workflows based on events such as code commits, pull requests, and issue updates.

### 2. Task Automation

- **CumulusCI**: Leverage CumulusCI to automate common Salesforce tasks such as deployments, data loading, and testing.
- **Custom Scripts**: Write custom scripts to automate specific tasks unique to your project.
- **Job Scheduling**: Schedule jobs to run at specific times or intervals.

### 3. Integration Automation

- **API Integrations**: Automate interactions with external systems using APIs.
- **Webhooks**: Use webhooks to trigger automation based on events in external systems.
- **Data Synchronization**: Automate data synchronization between Salesforce and other systems.

## Workflow Components

D2X workflows are built from smaller, reusable components that can be:

- Combined in different ways
- Customized as needed
- Versioned independently
- Shared across repositories

### Core Components

- **Authentication**: Handle authentication and authorization for accessing Salesforce and other systems.
- **Session Management**: Manage sessions and tokens for secure access.
- **Secret Handling**: Securely manage secrets and credentials.
- **Deployment**: Automate the deployment of Salesforce metadata and configurations.
- **Testing**: Automate testing of Salesforce applications and integrations.
- **Validation**: Validate configurations and deployments to ensure they meet requirements.
- **Notification**: Send notifications and alerts based on workflow outcomes.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Track and manage Salesforce metadata changes using functions organized under `d2x/api/sf/metadata/tracking`.
