# Repository Features

## Repository Types

### Base Templates

D2X provides base templates for different org patterns. These templates serve as the foundation for creating org-specific repositories.

### Org-Specific Repositories

Org-specific repositories are forked from the base templates. They represent individual Salesforce orgs and their configurations.

### Team Forks

Team forks are created from org-specific repositories. They are used for development and collaboration within teams.

## Security Features

### Branch Protection Rules

D2X enforces branch protection rules to ensure code quality and security. These rules include required status checks and pull request reviews.

### Required Status Checks

Before merging a pull request, D2X requires that all status checks pass. This ensures that the code meets the necessary quality standards.

### Automated Security Scanning

D2X integrates automated security scanning to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the codebase. This helps maintain a secure and compliant environment.

### Pull Request Reviews

D2X enforces pull request reviews to ensure that code changes are reviewed by team members before being merged. This helps maintain code quality and collaboration.
