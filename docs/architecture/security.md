# üîê Security Architecture

## Security Layers

D2X's security architecture is built on multiple layers to ensure the highest level of protection for your Salesforce orgs and data.

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- **GitHub Environments**: Use GitHub Environments to manage long-term credentials and temporary access tokens.
- **Two-Stage Authentication**: Implement a two-stage authentication process to separate long-term credentials from temporary access tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles and permissions to control access to sensitive data and operations.

### 2. Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- **Data Masking**: Use data masking techniques to protect sensitive information in non-production environments.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backup and recovery processes to ensure data integrity and availability.

### 3. Network Security

- **Firewall Rules**: Define and enforce firewall rules to restrict access to your Salesforce orgs.
- **VPN**: Use Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to secure communication between your on-premises systems and Salesforce.
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access to your Salesforce orgs based on IP addresses.

### 4. Monitoring and Auditing

- **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed audit logs for all access and operations.
- **Security Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring tools to detect and respond to potential threats.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports to meet regulatory requirements.

## Protection Rules

D2X leverages GitHub's protection rules to enforce security policies and ensure compliance.

### 1. Branch Protection

- **Required Reviews**: Enforce required reviews for all pull requests.
- **Status Checks**: Require status checks to pass before merging pull requests.
- **Code Scanning**: Automatically scan code for vulnerabilities before merging.

### 2. Secret Management

- **Secret Scanning**: Automatically scan for secrets in your codebase.
- **Secret Rotation**: Implement regular secret rotation to minimize the risk of exposure.
- **Access Controls**: Define access controls to restrict who can view and use secrets.

### 3. Automated Security Workflows

- **Security Checks**: Implement automated security checks in your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automatically detect and remediate vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
- **Incident Response**: Define and automate incident response workflows to quickly address security incidents.
