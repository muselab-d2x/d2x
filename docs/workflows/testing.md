# ðŸ§ª Testing Frameworks

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are designed to test individual components or functions in isolation. They help ensure that each part of the code works as expected.

### Apex Tests

Apex tests are used to test the functionality of Apex classes and triggers in Salesforce.

- **Setup**: Create test data and mock objects.
- **Execution**: Call the methods to be tested.
- **Assertions**: Verify the expected outcomes.

### LWC Tests

Lightning Web Component (LWC) tests are used to test the functionality of LWC components.

- **Setup**: Create test data and mock objects.
- **Execution**: Render the component and simulate user interactions.
- **Assertions**: Verify the expected outcomes.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests are designed to test the interaction between different components or systems. They help ensure that the components work together as expected.

### Org Configuration

Integration tests for org configuration ensure that the Salesforce org is set up correctly.

- **Setup**: Deploy the configuration to a test org.
- **Execution**: Verify that the configuration is applied correctly.
- **Assertions**: Check for any errors or inconsistencies.

### Data Load

Integration tests for data load ensure that data is loaded correctly into the Salesforce org.

- **Setup**: Prepare test data files.
- **Execution**: Load the data into the test org.
- **Assertions**: Verify that the data is loaded correctly.

### Feature Validation

Integration tests for feature validation ensure that the features work as expected in the Salesforce org.

- **Setup**: Deploy the feature to a test org.
- **Execution**: Test the feature functionality.
- **Assertions**: Verify the expected outcomes.

## User Acceptance

User acceptance tests (UAT) are designed to ensure that the system meets the user's requirements and is ready for production.

### Sandbox Prep

Prepare the sandbox environment for user acceptance testing.

- **Setup**: Refresh the sandbox and deploy the latest changes.
- **Execution**: Configure the sandbox for testing.
- **Assertions**: Verify that the sandbox is ready for testing.

### User Flows

Test the user flows to ensure that the system meets the user's requirements.

- **Setup**: Prepare test scenarios and test data.
- **Execution**: Execute the test scenarios.
- **Assertions**: Verify the expected outcomes.

### Acceptance Criteria

Verify that the system meets the acceptance criteria defined by the users.

- **Setup**: Review the acceptance criteria.
- **Execution**: Test the system against the acceptance criteria.
- **Assertions**: Verify that the system meets the acceptance criteria.
