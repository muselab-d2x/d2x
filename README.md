D2X lets teams deliver repeatable, composable Salesforce products and solutions that align with Salesforce's [Well-Architected Framework](https://architect.salesforce.com/well-architected/overview).

D2X defines a container image for Salesforce development, build, and delivery using CumulusCI and Salesforce CLI. This gives teams a cconsistent runtime environment for automation used in across the entire software product lifecycle.

MuseLab created D2X as the framework for all of our [services engagements](https://muselab.com/services), and we are proud to share it freely with the entire Salesforce ecosystem.

See [D2X documentation](https://d2x.readthedocs.io) for more details on using D2X — or try it yourself right now via [D2X Launchpad](https://launchpad.muselab.com)!
